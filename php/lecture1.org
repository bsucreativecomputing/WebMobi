* Introduction to PHP

Welcome to the first PHP lecture!

This lecture covers:

- Printing values to HTML
- Variables
- Strings and concatenation
- Arithmetic operators
- Conditional statements (if, elseif, else)
- While and for loops

PHP files always end in .php, but they can also contain HTML code
You just need to start with this tag:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php
#+END_SRC

** Printing
To print something in PHP, use the "echo" function:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
echo "Hello, PHP!";
#+END_SRC

To print a newline character, insert an HTML <br>:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
echo "Hi,<br>How is it going?";
#+END_SRC

** Variables
To declare a variable, its name must start with a dollar sign ($)

#+BEGIN_SRC php
$age = 32;
$myName = "Matt";
#+END_SRC

** String Concatenation
To print strings and variables, put a dot (.) between them:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
echo "My name is " . $myName . " and my age is " . $age . "<br>";
#+END_SRC

** Arithmetic
PHP has all the usual arithmetic operators:


#+BEGIN_SRC php
2 + 3;
3 - 4;
3 * 3;
44 / 3;
23 % 4;
#+END_SRC

But it also arithmetic assignment operators. These change the value of a variable in place:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
$x = 1;

$x++; // now x is 2
$x += 1; // now x = 3
$x -= 4; // now x = -1
$x *= -4; // now x = 4
$x /= 4; // now x = 1
#+END_SRC

** Data Types

#+BEGIN_SRC php
$myName = "Matt"; // string
$myAge = 32; // integer
$myHeight = 186.4; // double
$isTeacher = true; // bool
$nullVal = NULL; // NULL
#+END_SRC

** Conditional Statements
PHP has if, elseif and else statements, they work the same way as almost every other language:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
$food = "curry";

// if statement:
if ($food == "pasta") {
    echo "I like pasta"; // this code is executed if $food is "pasta"
}

// if and else statements:
if ($food == "pasta") {
    echo "I like pasta"; // this code is executed if $food is "pasta"
} else {
    echo "I don't like pasta"; // this code is executed if $food is NOT "pasta"
}

// if, elseif and else statements:
if ($food == "pasta") {
    echo "I like pasta"; // this code is executed if $food is "pasta"
} elseif ($food == "curry") {
    echo "I like curry"; // this code is executed if $food is "curry"
} else {
    echo "I don't like pasta"; // this code is executed if $food is NEITHER "pasta" or "curry"
}
#+END_SRC

** While Loops
A while loop will keep repeating while the condition is true:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
$cond = true;

while ($cond == true) {
    echo "This code will print over and over.<br>";
}
#+END_SRC

** For Loops
A for loop has three parameters: some initial statement, a conditional statement which stops the loop if false, and a statement which run after every loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    echo "i is " . $i; // this will print numbers from 0 to 9
}
#+END_SRC

This tag ends your PHP code:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
?>
#+END_SRC
